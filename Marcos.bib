abstract="This paper presents a method for formally representing Computer-Interpretable Guidelines. It allows for combining them with knowledge from several sources to better detect potential interactions within multimorbidity cases, coping with possibly conflicting pieces of evidence coming from clinical studies. The originality of our approach is on the capacity to analyse combinations of more than two recommendations, which is useful, for instance, for polypharmacy interactions cases. We defined general models to express evidence as causation beliefs and designed general rules for detecting interactions (e.g., conflicts, alternatives, etc.) enriched with Linked Open Data (e.g. Drugbank, Sider). In particular we show that Linked Open Data sources enable us to detect (suspected) interactions among multiple drugs due to polypharmacy. We evaluate our approach in a scenario where three different clinical guidelines (Osteoarthritis, Diabetes, and Hypertension) are combined. We demonstrate the capability of this approach for detecting several potential conflicts between the recommendations and find alternatives.",

In particular, classical languages designed for representing clinical guidelines, which were meant for producing diagnostic and treatment plans, present limitations such as for re-using, combining, and reasoning over existing knowledge. In this paper, we address such limitations by proposing an extension of the TMR conceptual model to represent clinical guidelines that allows re-using and combining knowledge from several guidelines to be applied to patients with multimorbidities. We provide means to (semi)automatically detect interactions among recommendations that require some attention from experts, such as recommending more than once the same drug. We evaluate the model by applying it to a realistic case study involving 3 diseases (Osteoarthritis, Hypertension and Diabetes) and compare the results with two other existing methods.}, doi= {https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-13704-9_44}}

In the educational context, the pedagogical characteristics are so relevant as physical and financial aspects to decide about hardware, software, man-machine interface, equipment and others components that will be installed in didactic laboratories. In this paper will be related the LAS/PUC-PR group experience in the implantation of an instructional laboratory to control system and automation. We develop a new methodology to teach learn control techniques by introduction of computer based education concepts into practical classes. We present the difficulties and the students' reactions during the development and application of the proposed methodology.}}
